# Coronary-Heart-Disease-Risk-Prediction
The objective of the project would be to predict whether a patient is under risk of contracting coronory heart disease (CHD) in the next 10 years, given the data about following 14 attributes:

• Sex: male or female("M" or "F")

• Age: Age of the patient;(Continuous - Although the recorded ages have been truncated to whole numbers, the concept of age is continuous)

Behavioral

• is_smoking: whether or not the patient is a current smoker ("YES" or "NO")

• Cigs Per Day: the number of cigarettes that the person smoked on average in one day.(can be considered continuous as one can have any number of cigarettes, even half a cigarette.)

Medical( history)

• BP Meds: whether or not the patient was on blood pressure medication (Nominal)

• Prevalent Stroke: whether or not the patient had previously had a stroke (Nominal)

• Prevalent Hyp: whether or not the patient was hypertensive (Nominal)

• Diabetes: whether or not the patient had diabetes (Nominal) Medical(current)

• Tot Chol: total cholesterol level (Continuous)

• Sys BP: systolic blood pressure (Continuous)

• Dia BP: diastolic blood pressure (Continuous)

• BMI: Body Mass Index (Continuous)

• Heart Rate: heart rate (Continuous - In medical research, variables such as heart rate though in fact discrete, yet are considered continuous because of large number of possible values.)

• Glucose: glucose level (Continuous)
