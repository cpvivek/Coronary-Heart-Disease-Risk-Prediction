# Coronary-Heart-Disease-Risk-Prediction


# Introduction
The contribution of ML in the healthcare industry is becoming more and more significant day by day. Looking into the health data of patients, along with demographic and lifestyle data can give us helpful insights into the medical condition of a patient. 
In this project, I'll be developing an ML Classification model to help predict if a patient is at the risk of developing Coronary Heart Disease, in the next 10 years, given their medical, behavioral and demographic data.

Objective:
The objective of the project would be to predict whether a patient is under risk of contracting coronory heart disease (CHD) in the next 10 years, given the data about following 14 attributes:

• Sex: male or female("M" or "F")

• Age: Age of the patient;(Continuous - Although the recorded ages have been truncated to whole numbers, the concept of age is continuous)

Behavioral

• is_smoking: whether or not the patient is a current smoker ("YES" or "NO")

• Cigs Per Day: the number of cigarettes that the person smoked on average in one day.(can be considered continuous as one can have any number of cigarettes, even half a cigarette.)

Medical( history)

• BP Meds: whether or not the patient was on blood pressure medication (Nominal)

• Prevalent Stroke: whether or not the patient had previously had a stroke (Nominal)

• Prevalent Hyp: whether or not the patient was hypertensive (Nominal)

• Diabetes: whether or not the patient had diabetes (Nominal) Medical(current)

• Tot Chol: total cholesterol level (Continuous)

• Sys BP: systolic blood pressure (Continuous)

• Dia BP: diastolic blood pressure (Continuous)

• BMI: Body Mass Index (Continuous)

• Heart Rate: heart rate (Continuous - In medical research, variables such as heart rate though in fact discrete, yet are considered continuous because of large number of possible values.)

• Glucose: glucose level (Continuous)
